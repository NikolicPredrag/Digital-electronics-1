## 4-bit binary comparator

### Listing of VHDL code from design file

```vhdl
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Architecture body for 2-bit binary comparator
------------------------------------------------------------------------
architecture Behavioral of comparator_2bit is
begin

    B_greater_A_o   <= '1' when (b_i > a_i) else '0';
    B_equals_A_o    <= '1' when (b_i = a_i) else '0';
    B_less_A_o      <= '1' when (b_i < a_i) else '0';
    

end architecture Behavioral;
